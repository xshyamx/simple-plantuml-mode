# Simple PlantUML Mode #

Major mode for [PlantUML](https://plantuml.com/) files.

Supports

- Xref navigation of component definitions & references
- Generating png preview files using the plantuml jar & java

Adds the following keybindings

| Keybinding | Feature |
|------------|---------|
| <kbd>C-c C-c</kbd>        | Compile diagram to check for errors |
| <kbd>C-c C-p</kbd>        | Generate diagram preview |
| <kbd>C-c C-o</kbd>        | Generate diagram preview & open in external image viewer |
| <kbd>C-c !</kbd>          | Select diagram type when starting a diagram |
| <kbd>C-c i</kbd>          | Insert a deployment diagram element with automatic alias generated |
| <kbd>C-c r</kbd>          | Converts a selection to a set of component declarations with automatic alias generated by prompting for the component type (Use <kbd>C-u</kbd> to put alias after description eg. for sequence diagram participants) |
| <kbd>C-u C-c i</kbd>      | Insert diagram element with prompt for alias |
| <kbd>M-&lt;up&gt;</kbd>   | Move line up |
| <kbd>M-&lt;down&gt;</kbd> | Move line down |
| <kbd>C-c c</kbd>          | Insert transparent rectangle container with dashed (Use <kbd>C-u</kbd> for dotted, <kbd>C-u C-u</kbd> for box) |
| <kbd>C-j</kbd>            | Expand special like emmet mode (Alternate <kbd>C-&lt;return&gt;</kbd>). Use <kbd>C-u</kbd> for dashed & <kbd>C-u C-u</kbd> for dotted |



## Why? ##

While there is already an excellent [plantuml-mode](https://github.com/skuro/plantuml-mode/) available what is the reason of this package existing?

- Did not like `planutml-init` loading language keywords for each session
- Did not like preview buffer popping up new window distracting the diagramming session
- Wanted errors in plantuml compilation to be easily accessible via the compilation-mode
- Wanted quick creation of plantuml diagram components
- Wanted jump-to-definition & list-references within the file

## Nice to have features ##

- Imenu listings for component definitions
- Simple emmet-mode like completions for relationships eg. `a->b,c<-d`
  expands to

  ```
  a --> b
  a --> c
  b <-- d
  c <-- d
  ```

  Running `C-u C-j` on the same expression results in

  ```
  a ..> b
  a ..> c
  b <.. d
  c <.. d
  ```
  Running `C-u C-u C-j` on the same expression results in

  ```
  a ~~> b
  a ~~> c
  b <~~ d
  c <~~ d
  ```

- Convert region of text to component type declarations eg. selecting the following lines

  ```
  Frontend API
  Data Base
  ```
  And running `plantuml-convert-region` or `C-c r` and selecting `component` for component type results in

  ```
  component fa as "Frontend API"
  component db as "Data Base"
  ```
  While running `C-u C-c r` on the same selection and selecting `participant` as the component type results in

  ```
  participant "Frontend API" as fa
  participant "Data Base" as db
  ```

## Installation ##

### Pre-requisites ###

1. Ensure a compatible Java Runtime Environment (JRE) is installed

2. Install the latest PlantUML jar file from https://github.com/plantuml/plantuml

### For Emacs ###

1. Clone the repository into site-lisp in the emacs user directory

	``` sh
	git clone https://github.com/xshyamx/simple-plantuml-mode \
	    $HOME/.emacs.d/site-lisp/simple-plantuml-mode
	```

2. Add to `load-path`

    ```emacs-lisp
    (add-to-list
    	'load-path
    	(expand-file-name "site-lisp/simple-plantuml-mode" user-emacs-directory))
    ```

3. Load & configure

	```emacs-lisp
	(require 'plantuml-mode)
	(setq plantuml-java-cmd "java"
		  plantuml-jar-path
		  (expand-file-name
		   "~/.m2/repository/net/sourceforge/plantuml/plantuml/1.2022.12/plantuml-1.2022.12.jar"))
	```
